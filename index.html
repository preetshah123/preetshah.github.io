This project has deepened my kownledge of SolidWorks and 3D modelling overall as I have learned many new aspects of SolidWorks. This project has also improved my creativity, imagination, and precision skills. The following pictures show the progress I have made on this project from the start of the year.   </p>

Currently, I am still on the early stages of the project: creating design concepts and starting on the code. However the robot will be fully built and operational by the end of March.</p>

                <p id ="electric">This design team is centered around building a fully electric Formula SAE racecar. I joined the team during my first term at the University of Waterloo because of my love for Formula 1. Currently, the team has taken the car apart fully so we can fix and improve the quality of certain parts, in preparation of the competition in mid June. The team is split into many different subdivisions as to improve efficiency and so I am part of the powertrain team. Currently, I am working on creating gaskets for the motor casing as to prevent any leakage. The SAE rules are very strict about leakage from the motor and this was something that the team failed on previously and we don't want to make the same mistake twice.

Although the amplifier itself is simple, it took a lot of thought and work. I learned a lot about how sound waves are affected by different surfaces and how to amplify them. I am very pleased to say the amplifier works really well for its cost and simplicity.  </p>

                <p id ="company"> ScentSation was a company a group of students built as part of the Junior Achievement program, selling hand made soaps and bathbombs. Although this was not a recent accomplishment, I learned a great deal from this experience. I was the President of the company and so I gained first hand exposure into the leadership role. Being part of the company also improved my teamwork and public speaking skills. This may not be like any of my other projects as it has no relevance to Mechanical Engineering, however it has been an important experience in my life as it has helped me improve my non-technical  and social skills.</p>
